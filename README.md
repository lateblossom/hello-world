Learning the Basics:
So, I'm learning how to use github right now in an effort to save all of my future projects as I begin my journey in learning how to be a programmer. 
A bit about myself:
I have no previous experience in computer programming, not one bit, but I'm excited to learn. 
I think of writing code as essentially the techy way of making magic, creating spells, if you would appreciate the comparison, 
and then creating something into the universe that wasn't there before. That's pretty cool.

I have a background in psychology and counseling, and I currently work in EMS, 911 and private.
I'm always looking to learn something different, something new, something that intregues me and makes me in awe of the things I can experience in this lifetime.

Here's to a new path, 
a new sunrise that can embolden and give life to this lateblossom.

Hello World!
